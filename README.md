# Databricks-Orders-Pipeline

## Business Requirements: 
  * The leadership team needs a Dashboard that shows order amounts and customer balances broken down by region, nation, and market segment ...preferably into hemisphere views for East and West
  * The orders should only contain data on or after 1995-01-01
  * The data needs to be updated automatically as new orders and customer data are transported into the s3 buckets

## Architecture:

## Notebooks: ðŸ“” 

* `dim_region_nation`: Region and Nation Streaming tables (bronze) pull data. region_nation Live table (silver) join them together
* `fact_customers`: Customers Streaming table (bronze) ingests data. Customers Live table (silver) forms by cleaning data and joining with the region_nation Live table (silver)
* `fact_orders`: Orders Streaming tables import data (bronze) and clean data (silver). orders_by_customers Live table (gold) joins orders (silver) with customers (silver) and groups/rounds data
* `hemisphere_views`: Eastern & Western Hemisphere Live tables select data from orders_by_customers (gold) and filter based on region

## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs):

Orders-DLT-Pipeline: Initial Run

   * s3 bucket contains 1 folder for each dataset (region, nation, customer, and orders)
   * Pipeline run is successful. Rows in green are successfully transitioned to tables and rows in grey are filtered out due to constraints

Orders-DLT-Pipeline: 2nd Run

   * s3 bucket has 1 new customers .csv file and 1 new orders .csv file added to their respective folders
   * Customer and Orders Streaming tables pull in only new records and add them to Live tables if they pass constraints
